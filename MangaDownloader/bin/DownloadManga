Creator: Daniyal
Idea Originated from Sakeeb

Sakeeb told me he created a program to download manga from a website
and saved it into a folder, I wanted to create a similar program. I'll
be trying to make this is as many languages as possible, as it is very
simple script.

Concept Idea #1
Feed it the link of the first page of the manga, and from there it
will try to generate the link for the next page using TWO LOOPS;
First try with a while loop for the next PAGE until the program
crashes. Second try with a while loop for the next CHAPTER until the
program crashes.
